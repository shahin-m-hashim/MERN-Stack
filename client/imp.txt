Very Very Important when connecting the front end and back end.
Hrs of debugging and finally found the solution.

When you are connecting the front end and back end, make sure that the back end is 
running on the same IP address as the front end. But in real-life applications, 
this is not the case, most of the time the back end and front end might have different origins.

Remember localhost:3000 and localhost:5173 are different origins.
The browser uses the port number to differentiate between different origins.

So, when you are connecting the front end and back end, and you are running the back end on a different 
IP address, then you have to enable CORS on the back end. 

To do this simply add the following code to the back-end express server.

server.js - 
const cors = require("cors");
app.use(
    cors({
    origin: "http://localhost:5173",
    methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
    credentials: true,
    })
);

Now, this will allow the front end running on http://localhost:5173 to connect to the back end.

Now in the front end use .env to store the backend URL
this is a very important part

localhost and 127.0.0.1 are not the same thing. 
localhost is a domain name that is used to refer to this computer.
127.0.0.1 is an IP address that the domain name 'localhost' resolves to.

Therefore when adding the base URL in the .env file, use the domain name 'localhost' and not the 
IP address, eg: VITE_APP_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3000/'

If you add VITE_APP_BASE_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/'

you might suffer from a bunch of errors related to cookies and CORS.

Also in the front end access this value in vite using -
const base_url = import.meta.env.VITE_APP_BASE_URL;
 
Now, you can create cookies without having to enforce HTTPS in development and works just fine

res.cookie("jwt", token, {
httpOnly: true,
withCredentials: true,
maxAge: 1 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 day in milliseconds
});




In case YOU WANT TO ADD HTTPS to your front-end URL in development, you can do the following:

import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import basicSsl from "@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [basicSsl(), react()],
});

Make use of basicSsl from "@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl";
Now your front end will run on https://localhost:3000/.

In case of using https create cookies like - 

res.cookie("jwt", token, {
httpOnly: true,
secure: true,
sameSite: "none",
withCredentials: true,
maxAge: 1 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 day in milliseconds
});

THE BASE URL is very very important incase something doesn't work, for eg:
1. CORS errors
2. cookies not being set without HTTPS
3. cookies set but not persisting after refresh and acting like sessions

These can happen as part of domain mismatch, so make sure to use the correct base URL in the 
.env file and access it in the front end using import.meta.env.VITE_APP_BASE_URL
