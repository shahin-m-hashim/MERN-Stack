React Architecture:

Assets:
The assets folder is used to store static assets such as images, fonts, and global styles (e.g., CSS files).
Purpose: Keeping assets separate from code makes it easier to manage and reference them in the application. 
For example, it allows for easy import and use of images and styles in components without specifying 
absolute paths.


Components:
The components folder contains reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, input fields, cards) that can be 
used across multiple parts of the application.
Purpose: Organizing components in a dedicated directory promotes reusability, readability, and easier maintenance. It allows developers to encapsulate UI logic and behavior into small, manageable pieces.


Hooks:
The hooks folder houses custom React hooks, which are functions that enable the reuse of stateful logic 
in functional components.
Purpose: Placing custom hooks in a separate directory promotes code organization and reusability. 
Hooks allow for the extraction of complex stateful logic from components, making it easier to share 
and reuse such logic across the application.


Services:
The services folder typically contains utility functions and modules for interacting with external services,
such as making API requests or handling data fetching logic.
Purpose: Centralizing service-related code into a dedicated directory promotes separation of concerns and code reusability. Services can encapsulate data fetching logic, API interactions, and other external integrations, keeping the business logic of components clean and concise.


Pages:
The pages directory usually consists of individual folders for each page or route within the application, 
each containing the main file (e.g., index.js), the page component, and associated styles.
Purpose: Organizing pages into separate folders helps maintain a clear structure, making it easier to locate and work on specific pages or routes within the application. This structure also supports code-splitting and lazy loading for better performance.


Contexts:
The contexts directory stores files related to the React Context API, which provides a way to share 
state across the component tree without having to pass props down manually.
Purpose: React Context allows for managing the global state in the application, making it easier to share 
stateful logic and data across multiple components without prop drilling. Placing context-related files 
in a dedicated folder helps in managing and scaling the application's state management.


Utils:
The utils directory holds utility functions and helper modules that are not tied to a specific component 
or page. This may include functions for validation, authentication, formatting, or general-purpose utility 
functions.
Purpose: Keeping utility functions separate from the main application logic promotes code organization, 
reusability, and maintainability. This folder can house various helper functions that are used throughout 
the application.
